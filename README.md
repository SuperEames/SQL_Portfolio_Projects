# Janesupa Eames – SQL Portfolio

**Hello, and thanks for stopping by! 👋**


This repository showcases SQL projects I’ve completed as part of my data analytics learning journey. The projects focus on data modeling, data transformation, and analytical querying using real-world datasets. Each project is designed to answer meaningful business or analytical questions and demonstrate practical SQL skills.

Feel free to explore the projects below, review the queries, and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.


## 📌Highlighted Projects



🏥[ Medical Insurance Cost Analysis](<Medical Insurance.sql>) 

**Data:** [Medical Insurance Cost dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mosapabdelghany/medical-insurance-cost-dataset)

**Focus:**  Healthcare cost drivers, data modeling, and analytical insights

In this project, I analyzed medical insurance costs to understand what factors drive higher healthcare charges. I designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables (age group, BMI category, region, smoker status, and sex) to support scalable analysis.

**Key questions explored include:**

  - How smoking status impacts medical charges

  - Cost differences across regions

  - The combined effect of BMI, age, and smoking

  - How family size influences healthcare expenses

**Key insights:**

  - Smokers incur nearly 4× higher medical costs than non-smokers

  - Obesity and age compound costs, especially for smokers

  - The Southeast region shows the highest average charges

  - The most expensive group is older, obese smokers

This project demonstrates SQL data modeling, transformations, joins, aggregations, indexing, and insight generation.




🤖 [Top AI Tools: Popularity & Valuation](<Top AI Tools Popularity & Valuation.sql>)

**Data:** [Top AI Tools: Popularity & Valuation (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardayavuzkeskin/top-ai-tools-popularity-and-valuation)

**Focus:** Technology trends, popularity analysis, and market valuation


This project explores the AI landscape by analyzing the popularity and estimated valuation of leading AI tools. Using SQL queries, I ranked AI tools to identify which platforms are most widely adopted and which receive the highest market valuation.

**Key questions explored include:**

  - Which AI tools are the most popular among users

  - Which AI companies hold the highest valuations

  - How popularity compares with financial valuation

**Key insights:**

  - ChatGPT ranks #1 in popularity and valuation

  - OpenAI leads the AI market with the highest overall valuation

  - Popular tools are primarily chatbots and image generators

  - Market confidence is concentrated among a small group of AI leaders

This project highlights ranking, filtering, aggregation, and comparative analysis using SQL.
